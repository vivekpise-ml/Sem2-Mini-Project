💡 Next Enhancements (If You Want)
Now that the core is stable, here are optional upgrades:
⭐ 1) Add ROC curve plots
Easy to add inside evaluate.py.
⭐ 2) Add feature importance plots
For RF and XGBoost.
⭐ 3) Add a Streamlit Web App


User enters URL


Model predicts phishing/legitimate


Shows confidence score


Safe for demo


⭐ 4) Add the RNN/Transformer model for raw URLs
Great for comparison with classical models.
⭐ 5) Create a project README.md (I can write it)
Summaries, diagrams, instructions — perfect for GitHub.
⭐ 6) Export as a Dockerized app
If needed for deployment.

🎯 What would you like to do next?
Here are options — tell me the number:
1) Generate a complete, polished README.md for GitHub
2) Build a Streamlit-based phishing detector UI
3) Add ROC curves + feature importance visualization
4) Add the RNN/GRU/LSTM pipeline (Phase 2)
5) Clean and format main.py for readability
6) Add logging instead of print statements
7) Create a "predict.py" for single URL prediction (CLI)
Just tell me 1, 2, 3, ... and I will do it!
